I am a Young Principal Investigator at School of Data Science, Fudan University. I am also a visiting researcher at Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, University of Oxford. Before coming to Fudan, I obtained my DPhil/PhD degree and was a postdoctoral researcher at FMRIB, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences/Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging at University of Oxford, with Prof. Stephen Smith (Oxford) and Prof. Christian Beckmann (Radboud). This is a world leading group carries out research into new methodologies for the analysis of brain imaging data and key collaborator in many large projects such as the UK Biobank and Human Connectome Project. I was working on designing advanced analysis approach for multimodal biomedical data, including brain imaging, genetics, behaviours and diseases, and the application for real clinical questions. As first (and co-first) or correspondance authors, I have published over 10 SCI papers in many high-impacted journals including Nature Human Behaviours, Nature Communications, Molecular Psychiatry, Medical Image Analysis, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging and NeuroImage.
