I am a Young Principal Investigator at [School of Data Science, Fudan University](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/). I am also a visiting researcher at [Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, University of Oxford](https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/). Before coming to Fudan, I obtained my DPhil/PhD degree and was a postdoctoral researcher at [FMRIB](https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/research/analysis-research), Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging at University of Oxford. I carry out research into new methodologies for the analysis of brain imaging, genetics, behaviours and diseases data, and their application for clinical questions. As first (and co-first) or correspondance authors, I have published papers in high-impacted journals including Nature Human Behaviours, Nature Communications, Molecular Psychiatry, Medical Image Analysis, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging and NeuroImage. Please see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=TDo57rsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) Profile for the full publication list.
